See [`DEVELOPING.md`](https://github.com/iampueroo/rComments/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md) on how to develop this extension. I'm currently (as of June 2020) refactoring the extension in order to add tests to make it easier to contribute. Believe it or not, I initially wrote this in college to learn JavaScript.
